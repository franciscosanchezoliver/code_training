Coupling refers to the degree of dependence or connection between different 
modules, classes, or components within a software system. It measures how much 
one part of the code relies on another. 

Low coupling is generally considered desirable in software design, as it 
promotes modularity, maintainability, and flexibility.

There are two main types of coupling:

- Low Coupling (Loose Coupling): This occurs when components are relatively 
  independent of each other. Changes in one module are less likely to have a 
  direct impact on other modules. Low coupling promotes modular design and 
  makes it easier to understand, modify, and maintain individual components 
  without affecting the entire system.

- High Coupling (Tight Coupling): This occurs when modules are strongly 
 interconnected, and changes in one module are likely to have a significant 
 impact on others. High coupling can make the code more difficult to 
 understand, maintain, and modify. It can also result in a lack of flexibility 
 and reusability.

Coupling is typically measured on a spectrum, ranging from low to high. Several 
factors contribute to the level of coupling between modules:

Data Coupling: The extent to which modules share data. Low coupling involves 
passing only necessary data between modules, while high coupling involves 
sharing a lot of data.

Control Coupling: The degree to which one module controls the behavior of 
another. Low coupling implies that modules have independent control, while high 
coupling means one module dictates the behavior of another.

Temporal Coupling: The degree to which the timing of one module depends on the 
timing of another. Low temporal coupling allows for more flexibility in 
scheduling and execution.

Dependency Coupling: The extent to which one module relies on the implementation 
details of another. Low dependency coupling involves minimal reliance on the 
internal workings of other modules.

In general, minimizing coupling and promoting low coupling between modules is 
a key principle in software design, as it enhances code maintainability, 
readability, and the ability to make changes without causing unintended 
consequences.
