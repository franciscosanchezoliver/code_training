Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a module or 
component of a system are related to each other. 

Low cohesion occurs when the elements within a module have weak relationships 
and are not closely tied to a common purpose. In other words, low cohesion 
implies that the functionality or responsibilities of the module are not 
well-focused or are too diverse.

Low cohesion can lead to several problems in software development:

- Difficulty in Maintenance: Code with low cohesion is harder to 
 understand and maintain because the different elements within the module 
 may not logically or conceptually belong together.

- Reduced Reusability: Low cohesion can make it challenging to reuse components 
  in other parts of the system or in different projects because the module's 
  elements are not well encapsulated and may have dependencies on each other.

- Increased Complexity: Low cohesion often results in complex and tangled code, 
  making it more difficult for developers to reason about the module's behavior 
  and relationships.

- Higher Risk of Bugs: Modules with low cohesion may be more prone to errors 
  and bugs because changes to one part of the module can have unintended 
  consequences on other parts.

There are different types of cohesion, and the goal in software design is 
usually to achieve high cohesion, where the elements within a module are 
closely related and work together to perform a specific, well-defined task. 
High cohesion contributes to modular, maintainable, and scalable software 
systems.
