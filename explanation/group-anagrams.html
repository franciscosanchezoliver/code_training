        <ul>
            <li>
                m: total number of words in the input array. For example if the input is  
                    strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"] then m=6
            </li>
            <li>
            n: the average length of the words because we have to count how many characters each word has.
    So we have to go to every single character in the string.
            </li>
            <li>
            26: The length of our count array (english abecedary)
            </li>
